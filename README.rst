A PHP library for geographic calculations:

* Calculate the distance between two coordinate points on the earth's surface (using Vincenty, Haversine, Great Circle or The Cosine Law)
* Conversion between units (metres to kilometres, nautical miles and miles).
* Convert coordinate notation (decimals to degrees, minutes & seconds and back again).

This is an improved (PHP5.3+) and tested version of `Geographic Calculations in PHP`_.
